# Contributing to KOBman
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:



1. [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/hyperledgerkochi/KOBman/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/hyperledgerkochi/KOBman/issues); it's that easy!


### Bugs and New Features

We keep a distinction between New Features and Bugs/Issues. We try to minimise the noise in our Github Issues stream by first having a conversation on approprate media (eg:  [KochiOrgBook! Whatsapp Group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/El6d3aAc6pYLEDEdQPVABY). ) 

- User Issues can be raised in our [issues section](https://github.com/hyperledgerkochi/KOBman/issues).
- New Features or Enhancements can be discussed in our issue section.

After accepting a new feature or confirming that a bug was found, an Issue may be raised filling in the provided issue template on the KOBman issue tracker.

**Unfortunately we will close any Github Issues that have not followed this process of prior discussion.**

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](https://github.com/asa1997/KOBman/issues/8) of a bug reported by a contributor .

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code snapshots if you can. [This contributor sample issue](https://github.com/asa1997/KOBman/issues/33) includes sample code snapshots that *anyone* can understand
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. 


## Processes expected to follow by each contributors:

- [Process for pull request](https://github.com/hyperledgerkochi/KOBman/blob/master/docs/user-guides/process-to-raise-a-pull-request.md)

- [Process for issues](https://github.com/hyperledgerkochi/KOBman/blob/master/docs/user-guides/process-to-raise-an-issue.md)



## Use a Consistent Coding Style
You must follow the coding standard described in the [KOBman review Checklist](https://github.com/hyperledgerkochi/KOBman/blob/master/docs/KOBman%20Script%20Review%20Checklist.md).
